# Academic Alfred Workflows
This repository contains some of my [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflows for academic life, with many of the workflows also connecting with [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). 

Please note that all of these workflows work the way that **I** want them to, so there are plenty of idiosyncracies and quirks in them that you might not like. If you're familiar enough with [modifying workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/) and—in some cases—with Things 3's [URL scheme](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/), it should be pretty straightforward to modify them for your preferences. 

## Research Projects

I use the following two workflows to organize my research projects:

- **create article folder structure** will prompt you for a project name and then create a `publish article on PROJECT NAME` directory in an `active` directory of whatever directory you keep your research projects in. The `publish article on PROJECT NAME` directory will contain subdirectories that I have found helpful. 
  
- **create Things project for publishing a journal article** will create a Things 3 project with all of the steps that I have found useful for beginning and publishing a research project. After prompting you for a research project name, it will create a project called "publish article on `PROJECT NAME`" with headings, tasks, and subtasks that I have found helpful. 

## Conferences

I use the following two workflows to organize my conference travel: 

- **create project folder structure** will prompt you for a conference name and conference year and then create a `NAME YEAR` directory within an `NAME` directory within whatever directory you keep conference materials in. This organization allows you to keep all years of a single conference within a single master directory. The `NAME YEAR` directory will contain subdirectories that I have found helpful. 
  
- **create Things project for attending an academic conference** will create a Things 3 project with all of the steps that I have found useful for planning and attending a conference. After prompting you for a conference name, it will create a project called "attend `CONFERENCE NAME`" with headings, tasks, and subtasks that I have found helpful. 

## Courses

I use the following two workflows to organize my teaching: 

- **create course folder structure** will prompt you for the name of a course and a semester and then create a `COURSE NAME` directory within a `SEMESTER` directory within whatever directory you keep course materials in. This organization allows you to keep all courses taught within a particular semester within a single master directory for that semester (though it could be rearranged so that `COURSE NAME — SEMESTER` directories are contained within a `COURSE NAME` master directory, which I keep thinking of changing to). The `COURSE NAME` directory will contain subdirectories that I have found helpful. 
  
- **create Things project for teaching a course** will create a Things 3 project with all of the steps that I have found useful for planning and teaching a course. After prompting you for a course name and a semester, it will create a project called "teach `COURSE NAME for SEMESTER`" with headings, tasks, and subtasks that I have found helpful. 

## Reviewing

I use the following workflow to organize my reviewing efforts: 

- **create Things task for a manuscript review** will prompt you for a manuscript name, an outlet, and a due date and create a Things task called "`review MANUSCRIPT NAME for OUTLET`" that is due on the specified date. The steps and notes in this task are based off of [Snyder](https://twitter.com/DressageProf) (2018)'s [**How to become a more effective reviewer**](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0016986218754495).
